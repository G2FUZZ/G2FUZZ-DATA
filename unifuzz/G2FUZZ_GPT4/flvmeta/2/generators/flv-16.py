# Sample command to generate a video with VP6 codec, alpha channel, On2 VP6 Scaling, Support for Script Data Objects, and Frame Skipping for Improved Performance.
# This example assumes you have a source video with an alpha channel and you want to scale the video and skip frames to improve performance.
# Replace 'input_with_alpha.mov' with your actual input video file path.
# Use the scale filter in FFmpeg to scale the video. Example: '-vf scale=1280:720' to scale to 1280x720 resolution.
# To add script data objects, use the 'metadata' option in FFmpeg. Example: '-metadata title="My Title"' to add a title.
# Frame Skipping: This feature is more about the playback capability of the FLV format rather than an encoding option. However, you can simulate this by adjusting the frame rate (-r) of the video to be lower than the source if you wish to reduce the video's complexity.
# FFmpeg is used here for demonstration; it must be installed in the system.
