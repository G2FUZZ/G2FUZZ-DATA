# Assuming the embedding into SWF requires specific settings or a placeholder,

# Here, we assume the original clip is sufficient as FLV files are inherently compatible with SWF.
# For demonstration, the same clip is used directly without modification.

# Ensure the clip is in a format compatible with SWF embedding
# This is a placeholder step as specific conversions or additional metadata might be needed 
# based on the SWF requirements which are not directly addressed by MoviePy.
# The FLV format is generally compatible with SWF for embedding in Flash projects.

# Write the clip to a .flv file with settings typically compatible for SWF embedding
color_clip.write_videofile(flv_file_path, codec="libx264", fps=24, audio=False)

# Note: The code itself does not explicitly change anything for SWF compatibility,
# since FLV files can be embedded in SWF projects.
# Additional steps might be required based on the specifics of the SWF project or Flash version.
