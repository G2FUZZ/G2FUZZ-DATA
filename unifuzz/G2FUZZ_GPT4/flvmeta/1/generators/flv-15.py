# Placeholder function for creating an FLV file with Enhanced Features
# This function does not actually implement FLV creation
# but outlines the steps you would need to take, including embedding cue points.
def create_flv_with_embedded_cue_points(output_path, cue_points, embedded_cue_points):
    # Step 1: Initialize FLV file structure
    # This step involves creating the FLV header, and specifying the file will contain video (and possibly audio)

    # Step 2: Add video/audio data
    # Normally, you would add the video and possibly audio frames here.
    # This would involve encoding frames in a supported codec like Sorenson Spark (H.263) for video.

    # Step 3: Insert Cue Points
    # Cue points would be added here. In an actual implementation, this involves inserting script data tags
    # in the FLV file that denote cue points. Each cue point could have a name and parameters like timecode.
    for cue_point in cue_points:
        print(f"Inserting cue point {cue_point['name']} at {cue_point['time']}")

    # Step 4: Insert Embedded Cue Points for Enhanced Navigation
    # Embedded cue points are used for chaptering and advanced navigation, similar to DVD menus.
    for embedded_cue_point in embedded_cue_points:
        print(f"Inserting embedded cue point {embedded_cue_point['name']} at {embedded_cue_point['time']}, for {embedded_cue_point['purpose']}")

    # Step 5: Finalize file
    # Finalize the file structure, ensuring proper headers are closed and the file is saved correctly.

    print(f"FLV file with embedded cue points would be saved to {output_path}")
