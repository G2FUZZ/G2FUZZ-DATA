# Placeholder function for creating an FLV file
# This function does not actually implement FLV creation
# but outlines the steps you would need to take.
def create_flv_with_cue_points(output_path, cue_points):
    # Step 1: Initialize FLV file structure
    # This step involves creating the FLV header, and specifying the file will contain video (and possibly audio)

    # Step 2: Add video/audio data
    # Normally, you would add the video and possibly audio frames here.
    # This would involve encoding frames in a supported codec like Sorenson Spark (H.263) for video.

    # Step 3: Insert Cue Points
    # Cue points would be added here. In an actual implementation, this involves inserting script data tags
    # in the FLV file that denote cue points. Each cue point could have a name and parameters like timecode.
    for cue_point in cue_points:
        print(f"Inserting cue point {cue_point['name']} at {cue_point['time']}")

    # Step 4: Finalize file
    # Finalize the file structure, ensuring proper headers are closed and the file is saved correctly.

    print(f"FLV file with cue points would be saved to {output_path}")

# Example usage
output_path = './tmp/example_with_cue_points.flv'
