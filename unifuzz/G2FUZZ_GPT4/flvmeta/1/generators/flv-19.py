    # Step 1: Initialize FLV file structure
    # This step involves creating the FLV header, and specifying the file will contain video (and possibly audio)
    # with considerations for secure delivery or encryption.

    # Step 2: Add video/audio data
    # Here, you would add the video and possibly audio frames, potentially encrypting the data
    # using the provided encryption key before writing it to the file.

    # Step 3: Insert Cue Points
    # Cue points are added here, possibly including encryption or hashing parameters to validate
    # the cue points' integrity upon playback.
    for cue_point in cue_points:
        print(f"Inserting cue point {cue_point['name']} at {cue_point['time']} with encryption")

    # Step 4: Encrypt FLV content
    # At this point, the video/audio data and cue points could be encrypted using the specified encryption_key.
    # This step might involve a full file encryption or selective encryption of sensitive parts.
    print(f"Encrypting FLV content with key {encryption_key}")

    # Step 5: Finalize file
    # Finalize the encrypted file structure, ensuring all data is securely encrypted and the file is saved correctly.
