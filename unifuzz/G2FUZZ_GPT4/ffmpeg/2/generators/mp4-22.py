# ISOBMFF Foundation Feature
# Since our video is already in MP4 format, which is based on the ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF),
# we inherently support this foundation. However, to ensure broader compatibility and integration of
# new technologies, we adhere to standards and practices that enhance this compatibility. This includes
# using widely supported codecs like `libx264` for video, which we are already doing.
# Further enhancements for ISOBMFF compatibility can involve specific metadata and structuring,
# but those would depend on requirements not specified here.
