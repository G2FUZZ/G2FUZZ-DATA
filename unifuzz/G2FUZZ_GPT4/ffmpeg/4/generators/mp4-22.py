# Note: Integrating BIFS (Binary Format for Scenes) within the Python environment directly is challenging due to the lack of direct library support.
# Usually, BIFS is part of the MPEG-4 standard and is not directly supported by the above libraries.
# A workaround would be to use external tools or libraries specifically designed for MPEG-4 BIFS, which are mostly found in research or highly specialized multimedia development areas.
# For demonstration, the following step is a placeholder and assumes the existence of a hypothetical tool or library `bifs_tool` for adding BIFS features to an MP4 file.

# Hypothetical command to add BIFS features using an external tool (this is a conceptual example and won't work without the actual tool):
# subprocess.run(['bifs_tool', 'add', output_final_path, bifs_output_path, '--feature', 'BIFS_2D_3D_graphics'])

print("MP4 file with video, audio, and (hypothetical) BIFS feature has been generated.")
