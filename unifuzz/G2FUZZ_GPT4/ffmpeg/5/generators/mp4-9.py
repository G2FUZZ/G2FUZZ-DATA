# CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
# CHAPTER01NAME=Chapter 01
# CHAPTER02=00:01:00.000
# CHAPTER02NAME=Chapter 02
# You would generate or write this file based on your chapter points

# as the embedding of thumbnails into MP4 files as chapter images is not straightforwardly supported by ffmpeg without additional work

# that involves creating the thumbnails, and then embedding them into the video file
# possibly using MP4Box or another tool that supports this feature.
