# To add MPEG-H support, you would typically need to encode the audio track of the video
# with an encoder that supports MPEG-H 3D audio.
# This code snippet doesn't include the audio encoding process,
# as it focuses on video creation and OpenCV does not directly support MPEG-H audio encoding.
# For MPEG-H audio, you would need to use an additional tool or library that supports MPEG-H encoding,
# and then multiplex the video and audio streams into the final MP4 container.
