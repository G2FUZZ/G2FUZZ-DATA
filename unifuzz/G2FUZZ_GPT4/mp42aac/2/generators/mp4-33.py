# Note: Adding PIFF (Protected Interoperable File Format) support requires manipulating the MP4 container
# to include DRM (Digital Rights Management) information. This typically involves using a tool or library
# specific to the DRM solution (e.g., Microsoft PlayReady, Adobe Access) and is beyond the scope of MoviePy
# and basic Python scripting. The following is a placeholder for the command to generate the video file.
# You would need to replace it with the actual commands or library calls required to package the video
# with PIFF-compliant DRM.
#
# This example uses 'libx264' for video and 'aac' for audio due to widespread support. Replace these codecs
# with 'vc1' and 'eac3' respectively, if your environment supports them.
clip.write_videofile(output_path, fps=24, codec="libx264", audio_codec='aac')  # Placeholder codecs

print(f"Video saved at {output_path}")
# Note: To truly implement PIFF with DRM, additional steps are required beyond this script.
