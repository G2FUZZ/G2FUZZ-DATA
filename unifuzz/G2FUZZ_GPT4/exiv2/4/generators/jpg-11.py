# If you specifically need to work with ICC profiles, consider downloading an sRGB ICC profile
# and loading it manually as shown in the commented-out code below:
# srgb_pth = 'path/to/srgb/profile.icc'
# with open(srgb_pth, 'rb') as f:
#     icc_profile = f.read()
# image.info['icc_profile'] = icc_profile

# For demonstration, we'll skip directly assigning an ICC profile and just save the image.
# This image will be in sRGB color space because that's the default for new RGB images in Pillow.
# JPEG images inherently use block encoding as part of their compression mechanism.
# Therefore, by saving an image as JPEG, we're already utilizing block encoding.
