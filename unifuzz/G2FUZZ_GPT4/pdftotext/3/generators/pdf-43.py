This PDF is designed to demonstrate the concept of Real-Time Collaboration and Review.
In a fully implemented system, users would be able to comment, annotate, and review the document content
simultaneously in real-time. This functionality would require integration with specific software or services
that support collaborative features in PDFs. Such features are akin to web-based document platforms,
enabling multiple users to interact with the document in a dynamic and collaborative manner.
