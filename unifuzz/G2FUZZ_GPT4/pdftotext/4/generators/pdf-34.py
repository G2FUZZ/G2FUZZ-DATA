# Note: Actual implementation of these features requires more than just adding text to a PDF.
# For example, creating a tagged PDF for real accessibility support would involve using a library
# that supports this feature directly, or manually tagging elements in a PDF creation tool that supports accessibility features.
# Similarly, text-to-speech, keyboard navigation, and article threads are typically functionalities provided by the PDF reader or the user's operating system.

# Save the PDF
