# Note: As of the last update, adding advanced accessibility features such as actual tagging for screen readers,
# and detailed alt text directly in the PDF with libraries like Reportlab or PyPDF2 might be limited.
# These features typically require more comprehensive PDF manipulation tools or libraries specifically designed
# for creating accessible content.

print(f"PDF with basic content created at: {file_path}")

# For actual tagging and more advanced accessibility features, consider using a library or tool
# that specifically supports creating PDF/UA (PDF Universal Accessibility) compliant documents.
# This example focuses on creating a simple, accessible-as-possible document with available Python libraries.
