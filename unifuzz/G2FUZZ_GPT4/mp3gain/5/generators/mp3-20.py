# Adding a feature for Legacy Support and Compatibility in the metadata
# Since the original code and the provided feature description don't directly translate to code,
# we will simulate this by adding a comment explaining the consideration for this feature.
# Note: Actual support for legacy systems and a wide ecosystem is inherent in choosing the MP3 format
# and does not require additional code. However, metadata or a readme file can be used to describe
# these capabilities or intents.

# Note: This placeholder comment is where you might document or implement features aimed at enhancing
# compatibility or supporting legacy systems, such as choosing specific encoding settings or documenting
# the file's compatibility.
# For example, ensuring the MP3's bit rate or sample rate is compatible with a wide range of devices
# could be a practical step, but these decisions would depend on specific requirements or goals.
