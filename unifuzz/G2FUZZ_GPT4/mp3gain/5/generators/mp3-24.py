# Note: MP3 format itself doesn't directly allow for "encapsulation of streaming information" in the way that metadata or tags do.
# However, some streaming parameters can be influenced by setting appropriate encoding parameters.
# Here we demonstrate setting bitrate and ensuring the file is exported in a constant bitrate (CBR) mode, which can aid in consistent streaming.
# For specific streaming info like buffer sizes, it would typically be handled by the streaming server or application, not embedded directly in the MP3 file.
