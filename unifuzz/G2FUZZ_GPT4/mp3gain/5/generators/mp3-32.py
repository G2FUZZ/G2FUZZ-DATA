# Pre-echo Control Mechanisms:
# Advanced MP3 encoders use pre-echo control strategies to minimize pre-echoes. 
# This is mostly achieved through various encoding techniques and is not directly controllable via pydub or FFmpeg parameters.
# However, using a higher quality setting can help, as it may enable better pre-echo control implicitly.
# Here, we'll specify a high-quality VBR (Variable Bit Rate) setting that should, in theory, offer better pre-echo control.
