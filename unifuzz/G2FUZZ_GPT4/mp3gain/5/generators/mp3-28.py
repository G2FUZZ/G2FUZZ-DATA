# As PyDub's API and the underlying libraries it interfaces with (like ffmpeg) do not expose direct
# manipulation of MP3's Scale Factor Band Data through the high-level API,
# one would typically need to work with a dedicated audio encoding library or tool
# that allows for such low-level manipulation.

# For educational purposes, this example will demonstrate how you might conceptualize
# the addition of such a feature, but please note that actual implementation details
# would require a more specialized library or direct manipulation of the MP3 encoding process.

# Placeholder for conceptual demonstration
# This does not change the MP3's Scale Factor Band Data but serves as a placeholder
# to indicate where one might integrate such functionality with a more advanced library.
