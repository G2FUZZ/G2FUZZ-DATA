# Adding a feature for Legacy Support and Compatibility in the metadata
# Note: This placeholder comment is where you might document or implement features aimed at enhancing
# compatibility or supporting legacy systems, such as choosing specific encoding settings or documenting
# the file's compatibility.

# Sub-band Energy Distribution Analysis
# Note: The actual analysis and optimization of sub-band energy distribution is a characteristic feature
# of the MP3 encoding process itself, where the encoder analyzes and allocates bits across the audio spectrum
# to maximize auditory fidelity while minimizing file size. This feature does not require additional 
# implementation in this context as it is an inherent aspect of the MP3 encoding algorithm.
# However, for educational or demonstration purposes, one might include detailed comments or additional 
# documentation to explain how this process contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of MP3 encoding,
# possibly supported by encoding settings that influence this analysis (e.g., bit rate, quality level).

# For example:
# Ensuring the MP3's bit rate is set to a level that balances file size with quality, and may influence how
# the encoder performs sub-band energy distribution analysis. This can be adjusted by specifying the bit
# rate when exporting the file. However, here we use the default settings for simplicity.

# Note: Actual implementation of sub-band energy analysis would require access to the encoding process,
# which is beyond the scope of pydub's high-level API.
