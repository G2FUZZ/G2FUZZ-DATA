# Additional feature: Encoding and Decoding Speed
# Note: This feature is conceptual and relates to the efficiency of the MP3 format itself.
# It's not something that can be directly modified using the pydub library or similar.
# However, you can control aspects like bitrate which indirectly influence encoding/decoding efficiency.

# For demonstration, let's export the audio with a specified bitrate
bitrate = "192k"  # Higher bitrates generally offer better quality but increase file size.

# Export the audio segment as an MP3 file with a specific bitrate
file_path = './tmp/silent_audio_with_encoding_speed.mp3'
silent_audio.export(file_path, format="mp3", bitrate=bitrate)

print(f"MP3 file with adjusted encoding speed (via bitrate) has been saved to: {file_path}")
