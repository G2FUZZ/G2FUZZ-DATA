# Export the AudioSegment as an MP3 file with parameters that mimic psychoacoustic model utilization
# These parameters might include bitrate, quality settings, and advanced encoding options
# that are typically used to engage the psychoacoustic model of the MP3 encoding algorithm.

# Note: The PyDub library uses the simpleaudio or ffmpeg/libav backend to handle audio data.
# To truly implement psychoacoustic models in the compression, control over the encoder's parameters is required.
# This example assumes the use of default settings provided by the export method, which internally uses
# psychoacoustic models when compressing to MP3. For more advanced usage, consider using a library
# that allows detailed control over the MP3 encoder settings.

# Here, we loosely simulate the effect by specifying a higher bitrate, which is not directly manipulating
# the psychoacoustic model but generally leads to better quality and less aggressive compression.
