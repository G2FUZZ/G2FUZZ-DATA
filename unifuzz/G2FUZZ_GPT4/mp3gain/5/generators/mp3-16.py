# Unfortunately, PyDub and Python libraries in general do not directly support adding DRM to audio files.
# DRM implementation often requires proprietary tools and adherence to specific standards which are beyond the scope of PyDub and most open-source projects.
# The following is a conceptual implementation that outlines how you might proceed with DRM, but it won't actually apply DRM.

# Ensure the './tmp/' directory exists
os.makedirs('./tmp/', exist_ok=True)

# Generate a sine wave audio segment
frequency = 440  # A4 note, in Hertz
duration_in_ms = 5000  # Duration in milliseconds
volume = -20.0  # Volume in dB

audio_segment = Sine(frequency).to_audio_segment(duration=duration_in_ms, volume=volume)

# Export the generated audio with a constant bitrate
file_path = './tmp/generated_audio.mp3'
# Use a common constant bitrate (CBR) for MP3
audio_segment.export(file_path, format="mp3", bitrate="192k")

# Conceptual step for DRM (not implemented)
# Here you would need to pass the generated file through a DRM-packaging process.
# This process is highly specific to the DRM system being used and often requires
# licensing or using specific software/sdk from DRM providers.
# Example:
# drm_protected_file_path = drm_package(file_path, drm_license_key, drm_policy)
# Note: This step is purely illustrative and does not represent real code.

print(f"Generated mp3 file at {file_path}")
# Note: The actual DRM packaging is not implemented here and would require additional steps and tools.
