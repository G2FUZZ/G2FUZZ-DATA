# Exporting the generated tone to an MP3 file including IS and MS Stereo Modes
# As PyDub's API and the underlying libraries it interfaces with (like ffmpeg) do not expose direct
# manipulation of MP3's IS and MS Stereo Modes through the high-level API,
# one would typically need to work with a dedicated audio encoding library or directly with ffmpeg
# commands that allow for the manipulation of these stereo modes.

# Placeholder for conceptual demonstration
# This does not directly enable IS and MS Stereo Modes in the MP3 file but serves as a placeholder
# to indicate where one might integrate such functionality with a more advanced library or direct ffmpeg commands.
print("Note: Actual integration of IS and MS Stereo Modes would require advanced audio encoding techniques or direct ffmpeg manipulation.")

# As PyDub does not support direct manipulation of IS and MS Stereo Modes, the following approach is conceptual
# To truly implement IS and MS Stereo Modes, one might consider exporting the audio data to a format that ffmpeg can work with,
# and then using ffmpeg directly with the appropriate flags to encode the MP3 with these modes enabled.

# Example of a conceptual command that one might use with ffmpeg (not executable in this context):
# ffmpeg -i input.wav -codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 2 -joint_stereo 1 output.mp3
# Where `-joint_stereo 1` might be used to enable MS Stereo Mode, depending on the specifics of the ffmpeg version and the libmp3lame codec.
# Note: This is a conceptual placeholder and not an executable Python command within this script.

# Export the tone as is, since this example does not implement the actual feature
