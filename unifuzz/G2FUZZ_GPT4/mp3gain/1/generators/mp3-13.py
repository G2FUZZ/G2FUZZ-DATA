from pydub import AudioSegment
import os

# Ensure the tmp directory exists
os.makedirs('./tmp/', exist_ok=True)

# Create an audio segment of silence
silence = AudioSegment.silent(duration=1000)  # 1 second of silence

# Export the audio segment as an MP3 file with error checking enabled
# Note: Pydub itself does not provide direct access to enabling MP3 error checking.
# Error protection in MP3 files is typically a feature of the encoder.
# As of my last training cut-off, Pydub uses ffmpeg or avlib for encoding, 
# but does not expose error protection features through the API directly.
# Thus, to truly implement this feature, you would need to use ffmpeg directly
# or modify Pydub to allow setting encoder-specific flags.
# Below is an illustration of how you might attempt to set parameters
# if Pydub or your encoding library supported it directly.
# Since it's not directly supported, the following is a conceptual example:

silence.export("./tmp/silent_mp3_error_checking.mp3", format="mp3", parameters=["-err_detect", "crccheck"])

print("MP3 file generated with error checking (conceptual).")
