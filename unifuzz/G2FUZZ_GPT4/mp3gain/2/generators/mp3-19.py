# Assuming advanced manipulation for pre-echo control cannot be directly implemented via PyDub,
# and the fact that PyDub does not expose encoder psychoacoustic model parameters directly,
# a placeholder for where this feature would be implemented is shown.
# This is a conceptual representation as actual implementation depends on the encoder's capabilities
# and access to its psychoacoustic model parameters.

# NOTE: To actually achieve pre-echo control, one would typically need to access and manipulate
# encoder settings directly, possibly using a different library or tool that allows for such advanced control.
# This might involve using an external tool or library like LAME MP3 encoder directly with custom parameters
# for psychoacoustic modeling, which PyDub does not support directly.

# For demonstration purposes, we're just noting the intended action here as there's no direct way
# to implement pre-echo control with PyDub's API.
