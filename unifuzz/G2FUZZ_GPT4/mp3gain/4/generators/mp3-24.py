# Encoding Presets and Modes
# PyDub doesnâ€™t directly expose encoding presets and modes via its API.
# However, we can simulate changing encoding presets by manipulating the parameters
# in the export method, such as "bitrate", "parameters" (which can include command-line
# options for the underlying ffmpeg process), or changing the format.
# For demonstration, let's simulate using a "voice" preset by lowering the bitrate,
# which is commonly done for voice to save space while maintaining intelligibility.

# This step is conceptual and intended to simulate the idea of using a "voice" preset.

# Introducing Subband Encoding feature
# Note: Direct manipulation of subbands is not explicitly supported by PyDub or its export method.
# This step simulates the concept of subband encoding by further manipulating the audio quality
# and format in a way that could conceptually align with the principles of subband encoding.

# Simulate "Subband Encoding" by further compressing the audio using MP3's inherent capabilities
# to encode different frequency bands at different qualities. For demonstration, we adjust
# bitrate to a lower value, indicative of more aggressive compression which could be seen as
# a simplistic proxy for subband encoding.
subband_encoded_audio = voice_preset_audio.set_channels(2)  # Use stereo to simulate subband handling

# Save the audio with our simulated "Subband Encoding"
