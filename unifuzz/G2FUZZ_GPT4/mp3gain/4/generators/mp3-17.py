# in the export method, such as "bitrate", "parameters" (which can include command-line
# options for the underlying ffmpeg process), or changing the format.
# For demonstration, let's simulate using a "voice" preset by lowering the bitrate,
# which is commonly done for voice to save space while maintaining intelligibility.

# This step is conceptual and intended to simulate the idea of using a "voice" preset.
