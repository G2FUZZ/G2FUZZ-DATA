# Introducing Encoding and Decoding Algorithms feature with custom manipulation
# Since pydub doesn't provide direct access or manipulation of the underlying encoding/decoding process
# such as MDCT or Huffman coding, this step is conceptual and focuses on demonstrating the idea.
# MP3 encoding and decoding processes are inherently handled by the library and the underlying ffmpeg encoder.

# Instead, we simulate an additional "feature" by creating a slight variation in the audio.
# Let's add a fade-in effect to simulate our "additional encoding process"
enhanced_audio = normalized_audio.fade_in(2000)  # 2-second fade-in

# Save the enhanced audio with our "additional feature"

# Adding a demonstration of the "MPEG Versions and Layers" feature
# Since directly manipulating MPEG versions and layers isn't feasible with pydub alone,
# and requires intricate access to the encoding process not exposed by pydub,
# we will simulate this feature by appending a metadata comment
# to illustrate the concept, as actual encoding details would be handled by the underlying ffmpeg library.

# Note: This step does not genuinely change the encoding version or layer but serves to demonstrate the concept.
