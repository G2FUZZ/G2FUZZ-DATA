# Save the image as a TIFF with tiling and Colorimetry Tags
# Note: The standard PIL library doesn't directly support setting Colorimetry Tags in TIFF files.
# However, you can use metadata parameters to pass specific TIFF tags, as shown below.
# For demonstration, we'll use generic tag values that should be replaced with actual colorimetry data
# based on your requirements. TIFF tags for colorimetry might include 34675 (ICC Profile) and others.

# Example ICC Profile Tag (34675). This value is just an example and should be replaced with a real ICC profile binary data.
# The ICC profile data should be loaded from a valid ICC file.
# This example will not work as-is for colorimetry purposes without valid ICC profile data.
icc_profile_example = b""

# Add more colorimetry-related tags as required by your application.
# Each tag would follow the same pattern: 'tag_number': value
# For example, '34675': icc_profile_example

# Since directly adding ICC profile or other specific colorimetry tags via PIL is limited,
# this example demonstrates the intended approach rather than a functional one.
# You may need a more specialized library or modify the PIL source code for full support.

# For now, we'll proceed with saving the image without the actual colorimetry tags to demonstrate the intended API usage.
