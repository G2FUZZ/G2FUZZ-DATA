The code above is used to generate flv files. Now, we need to extend this code to generate a new flv file that includes an additional `Cue points` feature besides the existing features. The description of the `Cue points` feature is as follows:
```
1. Cue points: FLV files can include cue points that mark specific times for navigation or interaction.
