** raw_llm: 1. Codec Support: FLV files typically use the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec for high-quality video and audio playback.
2. Metadata: FLV files can contain metadata information such as video duration, dimensions, frame rate, and more for better organization and retrieval of content.
3. Streaming Capabilities: FLV files support streaming, enabling users to watch videos as they download without waiting for the entire file to be downloaded.
4. Interactive Features: FLV files can support interactive features like cue points, which allow for navigation and interactivity within the video content.
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: FLV files are widely supported across different platforms and devices, making them a popular choice for sharing and distributing video content online.
6. File Size Efficiency: FLV files are known for their efficient compression algorithms, resulting in relatively smaller file sizes without compromising on quality.
7. Closed Captioning: FLV files can support closed captioning, allowing for the display of subtitles or additional textual information along with the video content.
8. Scripting Support: FLV files can include ActionScript code for creating interactive applications and games embedded within the video content.
9. Encryption: FLV files can be encrypted to protect the content from unauthorized access or distribution.
10. Audio/Video Synchronization: FLV files ensure proper synchronization between audio and video streams for a seamless playback experience.

*** assistant: 1. Codec Support: FLV files typically use the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec for high-quality video and audio playback.
2. Metadata: FLV files can contain metadata information such as video duration, dimensions, frame rate, and more for better organization and retrieval of content.
3. Streaming Capabilities: FLV files support streaming, enabling users to watch videos as they download without waiting for the entire file to be downloaded.
4. Interactive Features: FLV files can support interactive features like cue points, which allow for navigation and interactivity within the video content.
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: FLV files are widely supported across different platforms and devices, making them a popular choice for sharing and distributing video content online.
6. File Size Efficiency: FLV files are known for their efficient compression algorithms, resulting in relatively smaller file sizes without compromising on quality.
7. Closed Captioning: FLV files can support closed captioning, allowing for the display of subtitles or additional textual information along with the video content.
8. Scripting Support: FLV files can include ActionScript code for creating interactive applications and games embedded within the video content.

2. Cue Points: FLV files can contain cue points that trigger specific actions or events within the video, such as displaying additional information or jumping to a different section.
3. Alpha Channel Support: FLV files can support alpha channel transparency, enabling the overlay of graphics or text with transparent backgrounds on top of the video content.
4. Multi-Bitrate Streaming: FLV files can support multi-bitrate streaming, allowing users with varying internet connection speeds to watch the video at different quality levels.
5. Live Streaming: FLV files can be used for live streaming of video content, enabling real-time broadcasting of events or multimedia presentations over the internet.
6. External File Loading: FLV files can load external files, such as XML or text files, to dynamically control aspects of the video playback, such as subtitles or interactive elements.
7. Scripting Interactivity: FLV files can incorporate interactive elements through scripting languages like ActionScript, enabling developers to create engaging and interactive video applications.
8. Chapter Navigation: FLV files can include chapter markers for easy navigation within the video content, allowing users to jump to specific sections or chapters.
9. Cue Point Events: FLV files can trigger events based on cue points, such as displaying ads, changing video quality, or pausing the video at specific points.
10. Metadata Injection: FLV files can have metadata injected into them, providing information about the video content, copyright details, and other relevant data for better organization and management.
