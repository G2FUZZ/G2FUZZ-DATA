** raw_llm: 1. Lossy compression: JPG files use lossy compression which reduces the file size by discarding some image data.
2. Color space: JPG files support RGB color space which allows for a wide range of colors.
3. Metadata: JPG files can contain metadata such as EXIF data which stores information about the image.
4. Progressive encoding: JPG files can be encoded in a progressive manner, allowing for a low-quality preview of the image to be displayed quickly.
5. Variable quality settings: JPG files can be saved with different quality settings, allowing for a balance between file size and image quality.
6. Compatibility: JPG files are widely supported by various devices and software applications.
7. Compression artifacts: JPG files may exhibit compression artifacts such as blockiness or blurring, especially at lower quality settings.
8. File extension: JPG files typically have a ".jpg" or ".jpeg" file extension.
9. Layer support: JPG files do not support layers like formats such as PSD (Photoshop) or TIFF.
10. Transparency: JPG files do not support transparency or alpha channels.

>>  Lossy compression : 1. Lossy compression: JPG files use lossy compression which reduces the file size by discarding some image data.
>>  Color space : 2. Color space: JPG files support RGB color space which allows for a wide range of colors.
>>  Metadata : 3. Metadata: JPG files can contain metadata such as EXIF data which stores information about the image.
>>  Progressive encoding : 4. Progressive encoding: JPG files can be encoded in a progressive manner, allowing for a low-quality preview of the image to be displayed quickly.
>>  Variable quality settings : 5. Variable quality settings: JPG files can be saved with different quality settings, allowing for a balance between file size and image quality.
>>  Compatibility : 6. Compatibility: JPG files are widely supported by various devices and software applications.
>>  Compression artifacts : 7. Compression artifacts: JPG files may exhibit compression artifacts such as blockiness or blurring, especially at lower quality settings.
>>  File extension : 8. File extension: JPG files typically have a ".jpg" or ".jpeg" file extension.

>>  Metadata : 1. Metadata: XMP files store metadata information about the associated file, such as author, description, copyright information, and keywords.
>>  Extensibility : 2. Extensibility: XMP files can be extended with custom schemas to accommodate specific metadata requirements beyond the standard set of properties.
>>  Interoperability : 3. Interoperability: XMP files are designed to be easily embedded within various file formats, making it interoperable across different applications and platforms.
>>  Internationalization : 4. Internationalization: XMP supports multiple languages and character encodings, allowing for the representation of metadata in different languages.
>>  Versioning : 5. Versioning: XMP files can specify the XMP version used for encoding the metadata, ensuring compatibility with software that supports that version.
>>  Structured Data : 6. Structured Data: XMP allows for the representation of structured data through the use of schemas, properties, and qualifiers.
>>  Embeddable : 7. Embeddable: XMP metadata can be embedded within the file itself, ensuring that the metadata stays with the file even when it is shared or transferred.
>>  Standardization : 8. Standardization: XMP is an ISO standard (ISO 16684-1:2012), providing a standardized way to manage metadata across different file types.
>>  Preservation : 9. Preservation: XMP files can help in preserving important metadata associated with digital assets, aiding in their long-term archiving and retrieval.
>>  Accessibility : 10. Accessibility: XMP metadata can improve the accessibility of files by providing descriptive information that can be used by assistive technologies.
