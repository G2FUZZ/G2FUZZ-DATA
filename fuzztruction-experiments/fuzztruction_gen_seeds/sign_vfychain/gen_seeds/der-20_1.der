0ÇœÅﬂBeyond cryptographic keys and certificates, DER files can be used to encode any data that can be described by ASN.1, including various protocols' messages, making them versatile in network and security-related applications.ÅÍGiven their binary nature and standardized format, DER files are suited for portable data exchange across different systems and platforms. This is particularly useful in environments where bandwidth or storage efficiency is a concern.
