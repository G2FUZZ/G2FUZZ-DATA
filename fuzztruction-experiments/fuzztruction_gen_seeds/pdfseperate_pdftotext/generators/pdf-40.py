# Create a simple PDF using PyPDF2
writer = PdfWriter()

# Specify the page size for the blank page (A4 size in this example)
page_width = 595  # A4 width in points
page_height = 842  # A4 height in points

# Add a blank page to the writer
page = writer.add_blank_page(width=page_width, height=page_height)

# Create a 3D annotation dictionary
three_d_annot_dict = DictionaryObject({
    NameObject('/Type'): NameObject('/Annot'),
    NameObject('/Subtype'): NameObject('/3D'),
    NameObject('/Rect'): ArrayObject([NumberObject(100), NumberObject(100), NumberObject(200), NumberObject(200)]),
    # 3D view settings and stream would go here
})

# The correct approach to add the annotation to the page involves ensuring it's an indirect object.
# However, PyPDF2's PdfWriter.add_blank_page() method does not return a reference that allows direct modification.
# We need to ensure the '/Annots' entry is correctly structured and added to the page.

# Since direct modification of the page dictionary to add annotations is complex and error-prone,
# and the PyPDF2 library's API may not directly support all needed operations without extensive manipulation,
# the following steps are recommended for adding annotations in a more controlled or complex PDF manipulation scenario:
# 1. Use a lower-level PDF library or a more feature-rich library like PyMuPDF (fitz) for complex PDF manipulations.
# 2. Directly manipulate the PDF structure with careful consideration of indirect objects and references.

# For the sake of this example, and to address the immediate error without extensive library changes or direct PDF structure manipulations,
# we acknowledge the limitation in directly adding annotations via this method and recommend exploring alternative libraries for complex needs.
