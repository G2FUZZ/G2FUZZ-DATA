{"**Header Structure**": "1. **Header Structure**: COFF files start with a header that contains important information about the file, such as its type (executable, object, or library), architecture (e.g., x86, x64), and the number of sections in the file. This header is crucial for the operating system to correctly interpret the file's contents.", "**Section Headers**": "2. **Section Headers**: Following the file header, COFF files contain a series of section headers. Each section header describes a section of the file, including its name, size, and location in the file. Sections may contain code, data, or other information needed for execution or linking.", "**Symbol Table**": "3. **Symbol Table**: COFF files often include a symbol table, which provides information about various symbols (such as functions and variables) defined or referenced in the file. The symbol table helps in linking and debugging by mapping symbol names to their addresses in the executable code or data sections.", "**Relocation Information**": "4. **Relocation Information**: COFF files can contain relocation information, which is used to adjust symbol addresses at link time or load time. This allows for flexible placement of code and data in memory, which is necessary for dynamic linking and loading of shared libraries.", "**Debugging Information**": "5. **Debugging Information**: They can include debugging information, allowing developers to debug their code using debuggers that understand COFF format. This information can include source line numbers, filenames, and other symbols useful during the debugging process.", "**Endian Specificity**": "7. **Endian Specificity**: COFF files can be created for architectures that are either big-endian or little-endian, which determines how multi-byte values are stored. This is important for ensuring that the file is compatible with the target machine's architecture.", "**Optional Header**": "8. **Optional Header**: There is an optional header that can provide additional information for executable files, such as the entry point address, stack size, and heap size. This header is not present in object files but is crucial for executables."}
