{"Lossless Compression": "1. Lossless Compression: PNG uses a lossless compression method, allowing images to be reduced in file size without losing any image quality.", "Transparency Support": "2. Transparency Support: PNG supports alpha transparency, enabling the creation of images with varying degrees of transparency and smooth edges, ideal for logos and graphics.", "Color Depth": "3. Color Depth: PNG files can handle up to 16 million colors (24-bit truecolor) and also support 48-bit truecolor for more detailed images, as well as grayscale images without color.", "Interlacing": "4. Interlacing: PNG offers an interlacing feature, which allows an image to be loaded progressively. This means a low-quality version of the image can appear first and gradually increase in quality as more data is downloaded.", "Gamma Correction": "5. Gamma Correction: PNG supports gamma correction, allowing for the adjustment of the image's luminance or brightness, which can help match the appearance of the image across different display devices.", "Color Management": "6. Color Management: It includes support for color profiles, enabling accurate color reproduction across different devices by embedding ICC profiles.", "Metadata Storage": "7. Metadata Storage: PNG files can store metadata such as copyright information, text comments, and the creation time within the file, providing useful context and information about the image.", "Filter Algorithms": "8. Filter Algorithms: It uses different filter algorithms before compression, optimizing the image data for more effective compression by reducing the file size without affecting quality.", "Robustness to File Corruption": "9. Robustness to File Corruption: PNG format has built-in error detection features that can help detect file corruption, ensuring the integrity of the image data.", "Palette-based Images": "1. Palette-based Images: PNG supports palette-based images (8-bit color, 24-bit RGB palette), which can significantly reduce file sizes for images with a limited color palette, making it suitable for graphics and icons.", "sRGB Support": "2. sRGB Support: It inherently supports sRGB color space, which is a standard color space for web images, ensuring that colors are represented consistently across different web browsers and platforms.", "Indexed Color Support": "3. Indexed Color Support: PNG can store images using a palette of up to 256 colors, which is ideal for simpler images like logos and graphics, reducing file size while maintaining quality.", "Binary Transparency": "4. Binary Transparency: Apart from alpha transparency, PNG also supports binary transparency, allowing for a single color in the indexed color mode to be fully transparent.", "Two-dimensional Interlacing (Adam7)": "5. Two-dimensional Interlacing (Adam7): PNG uses a seven-pass interlace scheme, which allows an image to be progressively displayed as it is downloaded, improving the user experience on slow connections.", "Custom Chunks": "6. Custom Chunks: PNG allows for the inclusion of custom chunks in the file format for storing additional metadata, making it adaptable for specialized uses beyond just image storage.", "Soft Gamma Curve": "7. Soft Gamma Curve: Images can incorporate a soft gamma curve, enabling more accurate rendering of images on screens with various gamma values without the need for explicit gamma correction.", "Text Compression": "8. Text Compression: Textual information within PNG files, like comments and metadata, can be compressed, reducing the overall file size without affecting the image data.", "Robust File Structure": "9. Robust File Structure: The PNG file structure is designed to be easily recoverable in case of transmission errors, enhancing its reliability for storage and transmission.", "Animation Support (APNG)": "10. Animation Support (APNG): Though not part of the original PNG specification, the Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) extension allows for the storage of animated images that retain all the features of a standard PNG file.", "Stereoscopic Images": "1. Stereoscopic Images: PNG files can store stereoscopic images, which, when viewed with the appropriate technology, can give a perception of three-dimensional depth.", "Digital Signature": "2. Digital Signature: PNG supports the inclusion of digital signatures within the file, enhancing security by allowing verification of the image's source and integrity.", "High Dynamic Range (HDR) Support": "3. High Dynamic Range (HDR) Support: With extensions or through certain implementations, PNG can store high dynamic range images, allowing for a broader range of luminance and color details.", "Multiple Layers": "4. Multiple Layers: While not standard, extensions or proprietary implementations may allow PNG files to contain multiple layers, similar to PSD files, providing more flexibility in image editing and composition.", "Tile-based Image Viewing": "5. Tile-based Image Viewing: Specialized extensions or modifications of PNG support tile-based viewing, enabling efficient viewing and manipulation of very large images by loading only the visible portions.", "Lossy Compression Options": "6. Lossy Compression Options: Although PNG is traditionally lossless, there are tools and extensions that allow for lossy compression to further reduce file sizes for specific applications where some loss of quality is acceptable.", "Chunk Ordering": "7. Chunk Ordering: The flexibility in the ordering of chunks within a PNG file allows for optimization of loading times, with critical information placed early in the file for rapid display.", "Error Correction Codes": "8. Error Correction Codes: Some implementations may include error correction codes to further protect against data corruption, especially valuable in environments where data integrity is critical.", "Embedded ICC Profiles Version 4": "9. Embedded ICC Profiles Version 4: While PNG inherently supports color management through ICC profiles, newer versions of these profiles offer improved accuracy and compatibility across different devices.", "Variable Opacity of Pixels": "10. Variable Opacity of Pixels: Beyond simple transparency, PNG allows for varying degrees of opacity for each pixel, enabling sophisticated visual effects and composite images with smooth transitions between elements."}
