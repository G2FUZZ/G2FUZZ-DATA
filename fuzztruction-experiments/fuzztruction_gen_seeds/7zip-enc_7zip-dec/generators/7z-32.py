# CPU cores. The 'mf' parameter specifies the match finder for LZMA2 which can be adjusted for temporal
# data characteristics. For example, 'bt4' is a balanced choice. Adjusting this based on the type of data
# (temporal characteristics) might improve compression. However, note that 'mf' configuration is not
# directly exposed by py7zr's high-level API. This example assumes such a feature is available or will
# simulate the concept of temporal compression settings by adjusting parameters that are available.
