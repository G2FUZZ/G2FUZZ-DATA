This includes size constraints, range values, and mandatory elements, which are critical for the integrity and validation of the encoded data.0ÇÇ**Length Encoding**: DER files use a specific scheme for encoding the length of data elements, which can handle both fixed-size and variable-size data. This flexibility supports a wide range of applications, from simple data fields to complex structures with dynamic sizes.
