This includes size constraints, range values, and mandatory elements, which are critical for the integrity and validation of the encoded data.0Å⁄Å‘**Minimal Overhead**: The efficiency of DER's binary encoding minimizes overhead, making it well-suited for environments where bandwidth or storage efficiency is critical, such as embedded systems or smart cards.
