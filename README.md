# Description
We have made most of the key data from our experiments available. The unifuzz directory contains data from running G2FUZZ and four configurations of AFL++. The line_coverage directory includes the analysis logs of line coverage for G2FUZZ and other structure-aware fuzzers.

If you encounter any issues with the settings, please contact me so I can address them.
